**Recommendations:**
1. Utilize bit shifting operations instead of multiplication and division to optimize gas consumption.
2. Combine similar conditional statements to reduce gas usage.

**Optimization Code:**
```solidity
uint128 constant DIVISOR = 1 << 128;
uint128[] constants = [CONSTANT1, CONSTANT2, ...]; // add more constants as needed

for (uint i = 0; i < constants.length; i++) {
    if (absTick & (1 << i) != 0) {
        sqrtR = (sqrtR * constants[i]) >> 128;
    }
}
```
