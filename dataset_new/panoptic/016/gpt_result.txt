Recommendations:
1. Instead of using the logical OR operator (`||`), simplify the conditional check by handling the two conditions separately.
2. Avoid using the `msg.sender` and `from` variables multiple times in the conditional check.

Optimization code:
```solidity
bool authorized = (msg.sender == from) || isApprovedForAll[from][msg.sender];
if (!authorized) {
    revert NotAuthorized();
}
```
