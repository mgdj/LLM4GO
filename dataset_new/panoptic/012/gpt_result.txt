Recommendations:
1. Avoid unnecessary type conversions between int256, int128, and int64 as they consume gas.
2. Consider simplifying the subtraction logic to reduce gas cost.
3. Use bitwise operations to optimize calculations where possible.

Optimization_code:
```solidity
function sub(int256 x, int256 y) internal pure returns (int256 z) {
    unchecked {
        uint128 left = uint128(x >> 128) - uint128(y >> 128); // Extract left part and subtract
        uint128 right = uint128(x) - uint128(y); // Extract right part and subtract

        if (left > type(int128).max || right > type(int128).max) {
            revert Errors.UnderOverFlow();
        }

        return int256(left) << 128 | int256(right); // Combine left and right parts
    }
}
```

In this optimized version:
1. Replaced individual slot extractions and conversions with bitwise shifting and subtraction directly on the full int256 values, avoiding unnecessary type conversions.
2. Used uint128 for intermediate calculations as subtraction will inherently handle underflow by wrapping around due to Solidity's two's complement representation.
3. Checked for potential overflow in the resulting left and right parts and reverted if necessary.
4. Combined the left and right parts using bitwise shifting and OR operation to reconstruct the final int256 result.
