The current implementation uses external calls to a Math library for arithmetic operations, which incurs additional gas due to external function call overhead. By using inline assembly for these arithmetic operations, we can optimize gas usage. This is especially effective in the convert0to1 and convert1to0 functions, where multiple calls to the Math library are made. Inline assembly allows for more control over the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and can reduce gas costs, although it requires careful implementation to ensure security and correctness.
