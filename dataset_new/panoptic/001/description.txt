The LiquidityChunk library, integral to managing liquidity in a concentrated liquidity AMM system, originally utilized a series of functions to manipulate and encode data into a 256-bit structure. This report details an optimization approach that significantly reduces gas consumption. The primary method of optimization was the consolidation of multiple function calls into a single operation, leveraging direct bitwise manipulation. This approach reduces the overhead associated with multiple function calls and streamlines the encoding process.
