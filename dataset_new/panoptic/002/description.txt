The FeesCalc library, designed for calculating AMM swap fees in a Uniswap-like environment, originally contained a function calculateAMMSwapFeesLiquidityChunkOriginal. This function computed fees based on liquidity chunks, making multiple external calls to a Uniswap V3 pool mock contract and performing arithmetic operations to determine fee growth inside a liquidity range. An optimization was proposed to enhance gas efficiency by minimizing external contract calls and optimizing computation.
