### Recommendations:
1. Cache `msg.sender` outside the loop to reduce SLOAD gas cost.
2. Move `require` statement ahead of state variable modification to save gas in case of early exits.
3. Use inline assembly for emitting the event to save gas on data copying.

### Optimization Code:
```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) public {
    bool currentApproval = isApprovedForAll[msg.sender][operator];
    require(currentApproval != approved, "Approval status is the same");

    isApprovedForAll[msg.sender][operator] = approved;

    address sender = msg.sender;

    assembly {
        let eventCode := 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002
        let eventData := or(sender, shiftLeft(operator, 160))
        switch approved
        case 0 {
            eventData := or(eventData, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
        }
        default {
            eventData := or(eventData, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001)
        }
        log2(eventCode, eventData, 0, 0)
    }
}
```

This optimized code includes caching `msg.sender` in a variable, moving the `require` statement prior to the state variable modification, and using inline assembly to emit the event, resulting in potential gas savings.
