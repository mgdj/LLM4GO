Recommendations:
1. Use the storage keyword explicitly for the state variable to save gas.
2. Emit the event only if the approval status has changed to reduce gas consumption.

Optimized code:
```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) public {
    if(isApprovedForAll[msg.sender][operator] != approved) {
        isApprovedForAll[msg.sender][operator] = approved;
        emit ApprovalForAll(msg.sender, operator, approved);
    }
}
```
