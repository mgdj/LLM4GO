The provided Solidity code employs a sophisticated approach for manipulating 256-bit integers by splitting them into 128-bit halves. An area of potential optimization lies in the methods used to pack and unpack these integers. The proposed optimization focuses on enhancing the efficiency of these operations using more gas-efficient techniques in Solidity, which is crucial for minimizing transaction costs on the Ethereum network.
