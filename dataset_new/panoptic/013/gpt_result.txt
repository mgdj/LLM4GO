Recommendations:
1. Use bitwise operations instead of arithmetic operations for gas efficiency.
2. Remove unnecessary unchecked block as it's not needed in this case and could cost more gas.

Optimized code:
```solidity
/// @notice Write the "left" slot to a uint256 bit pattern.
/// @param self the original full uint256 bit pattern to be written to
/// @param left the bit pattern to write into the full pattern in the right half
/// @return self with left added to its left 128 bits
function toLeftSlot(uint256 self, uint128 left) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return self | (uint256(left) << 128);
}
```
