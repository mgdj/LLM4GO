Optimizing loop operations can significantly reduce gas consumption, especially in contracts with iterative processes over arrays or mappings. In Solidity, accessing the length of an array multiple times can be more costly than storing it in a local variable.Storing the length of the array in a local variable reduces the number of times the length property of the array is accessed, thus saving gas. This is especially beneficial in larger loops.
