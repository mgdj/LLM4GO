### Recommendations:
1. Replace sequential variable assignments with tuple assignments to reduce gas cost.
2. Avoid using unchecked blocks where possible as they increase gas consumption.
3. Consider using `SafeMath` operations for arithmetic to prevent overflows and underflows.

### Optimization Code:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ) {
    (uint256 id, uint256 amount) = (ids[i], amounts[i]);
    balanceOf[from][id] = balanceOf[from][id] - amount;
    balanceOf[to][id] = balanceOf[to][id] + amount;
    i += 1;
}
``` 

By making these changes, the code will be more gas efficient and eliminate unnecessary gas costs associated with unchecked blocks and separate variable assignments.
