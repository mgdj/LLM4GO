### Recommendations:
1. Avoid unnecessary type conversion where possible.
2. Make use of bitwise operations efficiently.
3. Minimize the number of operations to reduce gas consumption.

### Optimization Code:
```solidity
/// @notice Write the "right" slot to an int256.
/// @param self the original full int256 bit pattern to be written to
/// @param right the bit pattern to write into the full pattern in the right half
/// @return self with right added to its right 128 bits
function toRightSlot(int256 self, int128 right) internal pure returns (int256) {
    unchecked {
        return self + (int256(int256(uint256(right) & RIGHT_HALF_BIT_MASK)) << 128);
    }
}
```

In the optimized code snippet:
- We removed the type conversion for `right` and directly performed the bitwise AND operation with `RIGHT_HALF_BIT_MASK`.
- We then cast the result of the operation back to `uint256` to ensure that we're working with positive integers.
- By applying the left shift operation `<< 128`, we shift the bits to the left by 128 positions, effectively placing the `right` value in the right half of the `self` int256 variable.
