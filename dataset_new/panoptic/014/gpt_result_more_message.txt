### Recommendations:
1. Use unchecked block for optimized gas usage in arithmetic operations.
2. Avoid unnecessary casting for performance improvement.

### Optimization Code:
```solidity
/// @notice Write the "right" slot to an int256.
/// @param self the original full int256 bit pattern to be written to
/// @param right the bit pattern to write into the full pattern in the right half
/// @return self with right added to its right 128 bits
function toRightSlot(int256 self, int128 right) internal pure returns (int256) {
    unchecked {
        return self + int256(uint256(right) & RIGHT_HALF_BIT_MASK);
    }
}
```

In the optimization code provided above:
- Removed unnecessary casting of `right` to `int256` for improved gas usage.
- Utilized the unchecked block for efficient arithmetic operation.
