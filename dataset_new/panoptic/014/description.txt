In the provided Solidity code, which involves handling and manipulation of 256-bit integers, there is potential for optimization by utilizing inline assembly for direct memory access. This approach can significantly reduce gas costs by bypassing some of the higher-level abstractions of Solidity and directly interacting with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) memory. The focus of this optimization is on the functions that manipulate large integers, where direct memory operations can be more efficient.
