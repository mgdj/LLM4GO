Recommendations:
1. Avoid redundant variable declarations and calculations to reduce gas costs.
2. Minimize the number of external function calls to optimize gas usage.

Optimization_code:
```solidity
function getLiquidityForAmount1(uint256 liquidityChunk, uint256 amount1) internal pure returns (uint128 liquidity) {
    int24 tickLower = liquidityChunk.tickLower();
    int24 tickUpper = liquidityChunk.tickUpper();
    
    uint160 lowPriceX96 = getSqrtRatioAtTick(tickLower);
    uint160 highPriceX96 = getSqrtRatioAtTick(tickUpper);
    
    // ... computation using lowPriceX96 and highPriceX96
}
```

By optimizing the code in this manner, we have reduced the number of function calls and variable declarations, which should lead to lower gas costs when executing this function.
