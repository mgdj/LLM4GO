**Recommendations:**
1. Avoid unnecessary variable declarations.
2. Use constants instead of variables for values that do not change.
3. Simplify conditional statements.
4. Minimize the number of arithmetic operations.

**Optimization Code:**
```solidity
// Remove unnecessary variable declaration
require(denominator > 0, "Denominator must be greater than 0");
```
