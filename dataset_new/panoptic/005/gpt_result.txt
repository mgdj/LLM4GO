**Recommendations:**
1. Use inline assembly to perform the absolute value calculation efficiently.
2. Avoid unnecessary type casting and multiple operations in the conditional check.

**Optimization_code:**
```solidity
if (absTick > Constants.MAX_V3POOL_TICK) revert Errors.InvalidTick();
```

By applying the provided optimization, we removed the unnecessary type casting and simplified the conditional check, leading to gas savings.
