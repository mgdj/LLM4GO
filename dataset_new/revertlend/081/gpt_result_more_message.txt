**Recommendations:**
1. Use `uint64` instead of `uint128` if possible for `liquidity` to save storage gas.
2. Use `uint64` instead of `uint256` for `deadline` to save storage gas if deadline does not need to be a very large number.
3. Consider using `uint128` instead of `uint256` for `amountRemoveMin0` and `amountRemoveMin1` if the values are known to be within the range of uint128 to save on gas costs.
4. Make the `ExecuteParams` struct immutable if its values are set only once in the constructor.
5. If `rewardX64` is always a specific range, consider using a smaller data type like `uint16` to save on storage gas.
6. Cache the `tokenId` outside of the struct if it is frequently accessed within loops or functions.

**Optimization Code:**
```solidity
/// @notice params for execute()
struct ExecuteParams {
    uint64 tokenId; // tokenid to process - consider caching outside of the struct for frequent access
    bytes swapData; // if its a swap order - must include swap data
    uint64 liquidity; // liquidity the calculations are based on - consider using uint64 for less storage gas
    uint128 amountRemoveMin0; // min amount to be removed from liquidity - consider using uint128 if within range
    uint128 amountRemoveMin1; // min amount to be removed from liquidity - consider using uint128 if within range
    uint64 deadline; // for uniswap operations - operator promises fair value - consider using uint64 if deadline doesn't need large numbers
    uint16 rewardX64; // which reward will be used for protocol, can be max configured amount (considering onlyFees) - consider using smaller data types if value range is limited
}
```
