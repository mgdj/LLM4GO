deadline, rewardX64 and liquidity can be packed in a single slot.
SAVES: 4000 Gas, 2 Slots

You can pack the ExecuteParams struct into fewer storage slots by truncating the deadline to a smaller data type such as uint64. deadline can be represented within this range.

A uint64 data type can represent values from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. To convert this range into years we need to define the unit of time being represented.

If we consider seconds then: 1 year = 31,536,000 seconds.

So the maximum value a uint64 can represent in years is:

18,446,744,073,709,551,615 seconds / 31,536,000 seconds per year â‰ˆ 584,942,417 years.

This is an astronomically large value and far exceeds any practical use case in most software applications including smart contracts. Therefore, for most practical purposes a uint64 range is sufficient for representing time durations in years.
