**Recommendations:**
1. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments and condition checks.
2. Simplify conditional logic to reduce gas costs.
3. Minimize the number of storage writes.

**Optimization_code:**
```solidity
function configToken(uint256 tokenId, PositionConfig calldata config) external {
    require(nonfungiblePositionManager.ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Unauthorized");

    require(config.isActive && config.token0TriggerTick < config.token1TriggerTick, "InvalidConfig");

    positionConfigs[tokenId] = config;

    emit PositionConfigured(
        tokenId,
        config.isActive,
        config.token0Swap,
        config.token1Swap,
        config.token0TriggerTick,
        config.token1TriggerTick,
        config.token0SlippageX64,
        config.token1SlippageX64,
        config.onlyFees,
        config.maxRewardX64
    );
}
```

In the optimized code:
1. Removed the unnecessary owner variable assignment and directly checked ownership in the require statement.
2. Combined the conditional checks into a single require statement for simplicity.
3. Reduced gas costs by minimizing variable assignments and optimizing the conditional logic.

These optimizations aim to make the code more efficient and reduce gas consumption during contract execution.
