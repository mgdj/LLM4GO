To refactor the configToken function to fail early and save one external call on failing condition. You can move the check for config.isActive and the subsequent check for config.token0TriggerTick >= config.token1TriggerTick up before the external call to nonfungiblePositionManager.ownerOf(tokenId). This way if any of the conditions fail the function will revert before making the external call.
