To pack the struct efficiently you can rearrange the storage variables to minimize padding between variables. This optimization can help save gas costs by reducing the number of storage slots used.

Below recommended optimization can be made to this struct to save 1 storage slot per key in the mapping where this TokenConfig struct used.

*Note: I have tested this by adding test variable of TokenConfig type and run forge command forge inspect src/V3Oracle.sol:V3Oracle storage --pretty for both struct Optimized and Un-optimized. Unoptimized will take 3 storage slots while optimized one will take only 2 storage slots.
