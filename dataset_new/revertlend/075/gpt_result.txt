**Recommendations:**
1. Avoid unnecessary state updates and storage accesses to save gas.
2. Simplify the conditions for reverting to reduce computational complexity.
3. Minimize the number of calculations or complex arithmetic operations.
4. Limit redundant or duplicate checks to improve gas efficiency.

**Optimization Code:**
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 tokenId, uint256 assets) external override {
    bool isTransformMode =
        transformedTokenId > 0 && transformedTokenId == tokenId && transformerAllowList[msg.sender];

    (uint256 newDebtExchangeRateX96, uint256 newLendExchangeRateX96) = _updateGlobalInterest();

    _resetDailyDebtIncreaseLimit(newLendExchangeRateX96, false);

    Loan storage loan = loans[tokenId];

    // if not in transfer mode - must be called from owner or the vault itself
    if (!isTransformMode && tokenOwner[tokenId] != msg.sender && address(this) != msg.sender) {
        revert Unauthorized();
    }

    uint256 shares = _convertToShares(assets, newDebtExchangeRateX96, Math.Rounding.Up);
    uint256 loanDebtShares = loan.debtShares + shares;
    debtSharesTotal += shares;

    if (debtSharesTotal > _convertToShares(globalDebtLimit, newDebtExchangeRateX96, Math.Rounding.Down) ||
        assets > dailyDebtIncreaseLimitLeft) {
        revert GlobalDebtLimitOrDailyIncrease(); // Combine revert conditions
    }

    dailyDebtIncreaseLimitLeft -= assets;

    _updateAndCheckCollateral(
        tokenId, newDebtExchangeRateX96, newLendExchangeRateX96, loan.debtShares, loanDebtShares
    );

    uint256 debt = _convertToAssets(loanDebtShares, newDebtExchangeRateX96, Math.Rounding.Up);

    if (debt < minLoanSize || (!isTransformMode && !_isLoanHealthy(tokenId, debt))) {
        revert MinLoanSizeOrUnhealthyLoan();
    }

    address owner = tokenOwner[tokenId];

    // fails if not enough asset available
    // if called from transform mode - send funds to transformer contract
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(asset), isTransformMode ? msg.sender : owner, assets);

    emit Borrow(tokenId, owner, assets, shares);
}
```

In the optimized code:
1. Revert conditions for global debt limit and daily increase are combined.
2. Redundant subtraction operations are removed to reduce gas consumption.
3. Loan health check is now centralized for better code readability and gas efficiency.
