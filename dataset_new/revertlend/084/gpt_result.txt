**Recommendations:**
1. Remove the usage of the emit keyword for emitting events as it consumes extra gas.
2. Use the internal visibility keyword for the onlyOwner modifier to optimize gas consumption.

**Optimization Code:**
```solidity
function setVault(address _vault, bool _active) public onlyOwner {
    vaults[_vault] = _active;
}
```
