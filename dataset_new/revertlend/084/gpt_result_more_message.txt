Recommendations:
1. Cache state variables outside of the function to avoid multiple read operations.
2. Move the emit statement before the require statement to prevent unnecessary gas consumption.
3. Use a custom error message instead of a revert string for better gas optimization.
4. Consider using inline assembly for more complex arithmetic operations in advanced gas optimization scenarios.

Optimized code:
```solidity
function setVault(address _vault, bool _active) public onlyOwner {
    emit VaultChanged(_vault, _active);
    
    bool currentStatus = vaults[_vault];
    if (currentStatus == _active) {
        return;
    }
    
    vaults[_vault] = _active;
}
```
